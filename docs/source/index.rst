QSE
===

The Quantum Simulation Environment (QSE) package is adapted from Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) to suit the needs for an abstract representation for

* `i. defining quantum computing systems`
* `ii. computing operations/simulations`

in a vendor agnostic way. ASE's modular nature, and extensability make it very useful for a similar quantum computing application.
